I'm a self-taught software engineer. I started working as a software engineer when I was 17. I focus on Django and NextJS applications, mainly using TailwindCSS. I aim to thoroughly learn full-stack development. Currently, I'm learning more about AWS, React, and Docker networking. I specialize in machine learning, deep learning, and natural language processing. I've developed AI applications in my career for both research and fun. Currently, I'm interested in deep learning models and plan to learn more about cybersecurity in the future.
